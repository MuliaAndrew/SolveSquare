# SolveSquare
**Oddly enough, this program can solve _square equations_!** 
## discription
After you run the program, you will see the interface, where you need to enter the value of the coefficients a, b and c of square equation of the form *ax^2 + bx + c = 0*.
Then, after entering numbers, click __Enter__. CONGRATS, there *__solution__* of the square equation on your interface!!
## installation
  * To install this program you need to dawnload files from repository
  * To compile it with GNU GCC Compiler with linked [main.cpp](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/main.cpp), [solve_square_eq.h](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/solve_square_eq.h) and  [solve_square_eq.cpp](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/solve_square_eq.cpp)

__Also you can__
  * Dawnload Code::Blocks and install it 
  * Create there a project
  * Add to your project [main.cpp](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/main.cpp), [solve_square_eq.h](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/solve_square_eq.h) and [solve_square_eq.cpp](https://github.com/MuliaAndrew/SolveSquare/blob/main/solve_square_eq.cpp)
  * Compile project with GNU GCC Compiler
    * Also, after successful compiling, you can find an .exe application in directiry YOURPROJECT/bin/debug/YOURPROJECT.exe or YOURPROJECT/bin/realese/YOURPROJECT.exe
## launch
For launching need to open getted __.exe__ file. There an interface with next instruction
